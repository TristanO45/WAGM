I spent the entire day trying to setup my login/register page.
So far, it is rendering to the screen and submitting the correct username and password is successful

I now need to get my signup functionality working and link it to the login page.
The login page was taken from a materialui template

I also want to change the styling a bit and add a background (spinning vinyl record)
Hopefully I can have this all done by mid day Friday so I can start working on my feed page.

TODO TOMORROW:

- Watch YT video - Design Beautiful Signin & Signup Form using Material UI || Material UI || React
  to setup toggle form

- get signup functionality working.

- work on feed page.

6/24 5pm (Half day Break)

My login/signup page ui is setup and my login is able to retrieve data from the db.

Next step is to handle routing after login and creating a user in the db and routing to feed page after signup. Use Code Charlie provided as reference.
